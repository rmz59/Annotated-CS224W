CS224W - Annotated
==================

We'd like to add some codes to the slides of CS224W for better understanding. The two main packages that we used are
- [`NetworkX`](https://networkx.org/) for the creation, manipulation and analysis of graphs. It is a great package to explore and prototype on graph-related problems. `NetworkX` is completely written in Python and its performance is a bit poor on large scale graphs. Here is a nice [benchmark](https://www.timlrx.com/blog/benchmark-of-popular-graph-network-packages) of several popular graph packages.
- [`Pytorch Geometric`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for deep learning on graphs.
