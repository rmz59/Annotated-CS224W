CS224W - Annotated
==================

We'd like to add some codes to the slides of CS224W for better understanding. The two main packages that we used are
- [`NetworkX`](https://networkx.org/) for the creation, manipulation and analysis of graphs.
- [`Pytorch Geometric`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for deep learning on graphs.
