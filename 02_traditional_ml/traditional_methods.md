Traditional Methods for Machine Learning in Graphs
==================================================
This chapter covers typical tasks and useful features in Graphs at different levels.
- [Node level](node_level_tasks_and_features): node-level tasks ususally focus on node classifications. Useful features include ode degrees, node centrality, clustering coefficients.
- [Edge level](link_prediction_tasks_and_features): edge-level tasks focus on edge prediction, including predicting missing edges and predicting new emergences of edges. Useful edges include distances and neighborhood overlap between nodes.
- [Graph level](graph_level_features_and_graph_kernels.ipynb): graph-level tasks focus on classification and charactierzation of graphs. One can construct different kernels to characterize graphs.
